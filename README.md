# CSCI41_ScienceSim


Mr. Kerney's Guide to Understanding Who-Is-Doing-What::

Heap: Preet Jyotpreet
Hash Table:Emmy Issa
Score Count: Denise Gaona
Graphical Interface: Christiana Huiskens

I and Emmy talked about the name of our spaceship and came up with an idea that we can name it "Yenrek XLII." This is Kerney's name written backwards and XLII stands for 42(Kenery's lucky number) (lol) Is it okay Denise and Christiana? Feel free to make changes. 


HEAP:




HASH TABLE:

-Using STL, unordered_map
-Used to store information about astronauts
-astro.h header file for our "astro" class declaring astronauts with 4-digit ID (int), name (string), health (int), time_on_rocket (float)
-Associative will be Astro class and key will be ID (int)

Graphical Interface:: 

- unity/unreal engines for graphics.
// unity:: According Kerney unity is in 90% c++ and rest c#. Hence, we need to learn new language if we want to use unity.
//HOW does it incorporate user inputs??
//looks like im learning c#

 Score Count (In Main) :: 
 
 - we are making everything public, (lets not) so no get/set functions. //we should be using some private variables
 - keep track of atsro time on rocket // astro can only be there for 6 months. 
 - keep track of astro health. //How??
 - try making one puzzle of escape velocity. Refer back to Meyers notes ( I believe it v = GM/r^2).
 - keep track of rocket fuel. 
 - keep track of velocity in space.
 - keep track of general supplies.
